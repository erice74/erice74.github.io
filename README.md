=================
I want this site to be a portfolio of my multimedia work as I go through college and beyond. I want the layout and the content to be simple, but not boring. I want the title and buttons for the different softwares I'll be using and having content with to lay on top of a banner. I want a picture of myself with an about me section under the banner, then a section for contact info below that, and ending with a section with the copyright, FAQ, and help & support.
